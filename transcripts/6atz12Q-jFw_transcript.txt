60.26 - THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO NOT RUN
61.03 - FOR REELECTION.
61.66 - THAT IS IT.

119.32 - MANY FRONTS, PARTICULARLY THE
121.05 - ECONOMY WHERE PEOPLE ARE STILL
122.89 - FEELING THE BITE OF HIGH PRICES
124.96 - BECAUSE THE NUMBER, THE
127.43 - PERCENTAGE OF INFLATION HAS COME

128.46 - BUT IT WAS ON TOP OF A PERCENT,
131.00 - 9% AND IT WILL TAKE YEARS FOR

142.31 - BECAUSE THAT HELPS TRUMP.
143.31 - IT IS EMPTY GLORY ABOUT HOW
145.21 - GREAT HIS POLICIES WERE, AND NO
148.05 - ACTUAL AWARENESS OF WHAT PEOPLE

250.28 - TO KAMALA AND HE'S DONE.
251.62 - >> Emily: SHE WAS ASKED THE
252.99 - QUESTION WHETHER POINTED OUT
254.32 - EARLIER, WAS HE DONE OR TOLD HE
256.06 - WAS DONE?
256.89 - THE QUESTION WAS, DOES HE FILLED
258.93 - THE TRADE BY THAT?
259.73 - LET'S LISTEN TO HER ANSWER.
262.36 - >> PEOPLE LOVE JOE BIDEN THERE
265.03 - WAS A GREAT EXPRESSION WHITE HIS
268.13 - PARTY, PEOPLE TALKING ON

275.98 - THERE WAS A PIE LINE TO GET HIM
276.91 - TO STEP DOWN BY THE DEMOCRATS.
281.75 - AND MOVIE STARS, GEORGE CLOONEY.
284.32 - BUT DOES JOE FEEL BETRAYED BY
285.49 - ANY OF THAT, OR DOES HE
286.45 - UNDERSTAND IT WAS FOR THE
288.95 - COUNTRY ALSO?

296.10 - LIKE I SAID OF THEM HE HAS A BIG
297.30 - HEART AND HE UNDERSTANDS WHERE
299.43 - PEOPLE ART DEAL MY CAR.
301.00 - AND HAVING FOUND THIS 36 YEARS
302.63 - AS A SENATOR, EIGHT YEARS AS
306.51 - VICE PRESIDENT AND NOW AS
308.07 - VICE PRESIDENT, HE GETS WHERE WE
310.41 - ARE AS A COUNTRY.

342.77 - TALKED ABOUT IF YOU ARE CHINA,

357.96 - DOES THAT TELL OUR ENEMIES
358.59 - AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW WISH
360.69 - MARK THAT IS THE BIGGER CONCERN,
363.46 - I THINK, ON TOP OF THE FACT WE
364.36 - ARE LEARNING SO MUCH MORE ABOUTE
367.57 - WORLD LEADERS ARE SEEING AND TAE
370.30 - SCENES AT THE G7, AT NATO, NOT
372.70 - JUST THIS YEAR BUT TWO YEARS
376.51 - AGO.

390.32 - PRESIDENT.
390.82 - I AGREE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS
392.19 - UNPRECEDENTED BUT NOT FOR THE
394.36 - REASON SHE STATED.
396.10 - >> Paul: WE'VE NEVER HAVE THE
396.96 - SORT OF CONVERSATIONS IN THIS
398.26 - COUNTRY.
